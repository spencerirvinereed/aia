    "text": "Dr. Anthony Bradley, author of the new book Black and Tired: Essays on Race, Politics, Culture, and International Development, spoke at the Heritage Foundation about his research on the downward moral trend of black culture in America.\nAs an associate professor of theology at King’s College in New York, Dr. Bradley demonstrated his thorough knowledge and experience throughout the book event. He referred to American exceptionalism with a personal anecdote, of how his relatives own the plantation where their ancestors were enslaved. He pointed out that “there are not many other countries around the world where subdominant cultures rise to that level, that status” of equality from the depths of slavery.\nDr. Bradley saw that the principles that made America great are now “being sabotaged and eroded by those who have good intentions, but often do not think through the consequences of [their decisions],” where the “black underclass” has been the most affected culture by these decisions. He said that by “concentrating power in the hands of a few people leads to more oppression, not less,” and that this has been the story of the “black experience in America.” He regretfully acknowledged that the civil rights movement of Dr. Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, and others has been “hijacked by the organizational narcissism that we find among politicians…operating under the delusion that [they have the] expertise and capacity to solve society’s problems.” Also, he explained that the basis of the civil rights movement was a search for human dignity for the black community, and today it is about “zero sum economics” and “as if life were a race, or a competition.”\nHe admitted that he sits “on the same political island as Thomas Sowel, and Walter Williams, friendless, with the understanding…economic liberation…is inseparable from honoring the dignity of blackness.” As a religious man himself, Dr. Bradley noted that the current decay in the black community has occurred because “the less religion in society, the more people turn to government”. In citing Alexis de Toqueville, he made the point that without religion in society, an “inordinate love for material gratification” will lead democracy in the wrong direction. De Toqueville recognized that religion exists“to purify, control, and restrain the exclusive taste…that men acquire in times of equality.” Today, he said, some see socialism and communism as a fight “for justified injustice…it’s called ‘people doing their fair share.’” The civil rights movement has shifted from human dignity, “derailed” by politics and “bling,” in choosing political clout as a means of equality over the marketplace. Other ethnic groups, Dr. Bradley pointed out, “chose the marketplace as a means of social and economic mobility as opposed to politics.”\nReferring to flash mob thieves, as he called them, Dr. Bradley suggested bringing them to the statue of Dr. Martin Luther King and asking, “What would Dr. King say to you right now?” He saw these actions as an affront to the civil rights movement and Dr. King’s dream of equality; “Every time a flash mob steals, it’s robbing King of his dream, from Philadelphia to Chicago to here in Washington, D.C.” In place of progress and achievement, “young people are trading…[for an] adrenaline rush of stealing from others.” As the speaker noted, Dr. King taught that “political and social frustration…does not justify breaking the law.” He then posed several questions on how society neglects “forming the youth into people of character,” or how society raises the youth on “class warfare” and “redistribution” and yet is surprised when flash mob thieves rule the headlines. “Radical individual and moral relativism” now defines society as the “criminal flash mobs expose [society’s] progressive failure.” The absence of morality, which Bradley believes “could end the recession for good,” has only exacerbated today’s societal problems. He strongly advocates the belief “that a resurgence of virtue would give rise to a generation of moral and law-abiding citizens,” and help the black community rise from their dependent state to realize Dr. King’s dream.\nDr. Bradley cited a study in Howard University’s Journal of Negro Education, a respected academic journal, of how black teenagers who attend church services often are more likely to receive a college education. The study also found that the black-white student achievement gap “was eliminated” when black students attended church services often. Possible reasons for thse results, according to the Dr. Bradley, are that black churches provide mentors and role models, and that parents have the opportunity to teach from the heart based on religious values.\nHe then described the problems of raising the minimum wage for the black community. More often than not, Dr. Bradley said, people do not think of long-term consequences of raising the minimum wage. He firmly believes it “hurts minorities, it actually hurts teens, those who don’t have skills.” As a result, businesses will employ smaller amounts of less skilled, minimum-wage workers because the cost of employing them increases with higher wages. He noted that the money to pay the wage increase “doesn’t magically appear. It has to come from somewhere.” Other consequences of raising the minimum wage include laying off low-skilled workers, skirting employment laws, hiring illegals, under-the-table payment of employees, or moving jobs elsewhere. UConn professor Kenneth Couch estimated that for every $1 rise in the minimum wage reduces teenage employment opportunity by 140,000 jobs.\nThe underlying problem of the business world, according to Dr. Bradley, is the “racist ideology” that “blacks don’t think, they are told what to do.” Some view themselves as elites, or what he terms as “surrogate third parties,” who then manage and make decisions for the masses. The existence of these elites, as Dr. Bradley stated, “was the black experience during slavery and Jim Crow.” The resolution to this problem is “political and social empowerment” of the black community that will occur when society recognizes that power in the hands of a few elites undermines human dignity. Dr. Bradley believes that “this nation will go bankrupt”  if these social and economic issues are not resolved. As he sees it, “the hip-hop generation represents the most ‘un-churched’ group of African Americans since the plantation.”\nSpencer Irvine is a research assistant at Accuracy in Academia.\nIf you would like to comment on this article, e-mail mal.kline@academia.org"

    "title": "Professors Deconstruct Obama’s Muscular Presidency",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Law professors Jonathan Turley of George Washington University and Nicholas Rosenkranz of Georgetown slammed President Obama’s “muscular presidency” as dangerously unconstitutional. The Federalist Society hosted these speakers in a panel discussion entitled, “Suspension of Laws: What are the Limits of Executive Authority?”\n\n\n\njonathan turley\n\n\nTurley said that President Obama has completely ignored and “circumvented” Congress. After all of Obama’s rhetoric, speeches and subsequent actions, Turley said, “The irony is that he didn’t have to circumvent Congress” to achieve his own goals. As a law professor at George Washington, he could only say, “I’m left scratching my head” in trying to understand Obama’s vision of the presidency. He said, “It’s not that we [haven’t had] circumvention of Congress in the past, [but] it has been accelerating under this president.”\nTurley noted that in the last State of the Union address, “President Obama went to Congress and said he intended to circumvent Congress and to act alone in areas where Congress has either blocked him or failed to act.” Turley was shocked by the response by sitting congressional members to Obama’s statement. He continued, “Now that alone was quite surprising, but what was more surprising, [the] rapturous applause [he got]. I look at this body, of both houses, applauding a president who just said he would circumvent them and would act unilaterally…it bordered on self-loathing.” This “self-loathing” and “rapturous applause” by Congress was, as Turley said, “Something the framers wouldn’t have anticipated.”\nHe worried, “Our system is changing in a very fundamental way, and in my view, is a very dangerous way.” Turley compared the three branches of government, judicial, legislative and executive branches, as ones “held together in a type of orbit…they check each other and create stability through that check and balance system and separation of power.” Today, under Obama, “the executive branch has …aggregated power to the point that it has created instability” in the country. As a result, these actions “can create instability in society” as a whole and Turley said, “That was never what the framers envisioned.” Now, Americans are seeing “the shift of power to federal agencies, which are now exercising judicial and executive power” and a disregard for the long-held belief in separation of powers.\n“I have never said that President Obama is a dictator,” said Turley, “but I do believe that what he is doing through circumvention of Congress…he is becoming a government unto himself.” Even as a supporter of his policies, Turley warned, “Once this space expands, the gas will fill it equally” and Obama’s supporters “will rue the day that they remained silent in the face of change in this system.” Why? Turley pointed out, “The next president can do the same” and expand his presidential and executive powers. Then, “it will be hard for people to reject, who were silent today.” It would, he argued, be the “height of hypocrisy.”\nDuring Obama’s terms as president, Turley found, “The most significant…involved changes that were rejected by Congress…and the president responded by carrying out the same decisions or policies under his unilateral authority.” One such example: President Obama’s executive orders implementing the DREAM Act that a Democratic Congress would not pass, the act which gives free college tuition to illegal immigrants.\nRosenkranz said, “Congress repeatedly declines to pass it [the DREAM Act]” and yet, Obama will “behave as if it were [passed].” Some defend Obama and say that he is trying to conserve executive resources, but Rosenkranz said, “In this case, it is quite clear that he is not trying” to do so. For example, “it is free for the federal government” to enforce immigration law. However, Obama went ahead and “exempted millions of people from the immigration law.” In his opinion, “This exemption has a distinctly legislative character” and is “a blanket policy [affecting] 1.67 million people.”\nAdditionally, Turley said, “The power of the purse has become almost an urban legend or almost a constitutional legend” under Obama. “There’s so much money sloshing around in the executive branch that Congress has lost the power of the purse,” he said. With ObamaCare, Turley said, “[Obama] took $454 million from a dedicated purpose and shifted it over on his own purpose.” With Libya, “Not only did President Obama say that he alone defines what a war is, there was no room for the court, no room for Congress, as long as he didn’t call it a war, it would not trigger the Constitution, but was really unsettling that he funded that war entirely out of discretionary funds. He actually carried out a war without having to go to Congress at all.”\nHe tempered his criticism slightly when he stated, “It is not even about President Obama; it’s about our constitutional system… [because] this system is changing so fast and so significantly that I don’t know what system we’re left with.” Turley feared that Obama has created a top-down executive government model, in which “that system will be insulated” from popular opinion, also known as Congress. “Congress, with all its faults, is the thumping heart of the Madisonian system,” said Turley. Now Obama has created “the very danger that we hoped to avoid.”\nTurley said, “There’s a reason why we’re not getting things done…we’re divided, we’re a divided nation, and Congress looks exactly like the nation.” He defended the role and makeup of Congress because “that’s what Congress is supposed to be; it’s supposed to be a reflection of the public. So what you’re saying is that you want to circumvent” the public. Turley pointed out, “The reason why the President is circumventing Congress is because Congress is divided and cannot get anything done.” He warned Obama’s supporters, “When you argue for a muscular presidency…you have to take note of what that means.”\nBased on Obama’s actions, Turley mentioned, “Now, that’s a muscular presidency, it is not the presidency that’s a part of this Constitution.” Today, “there really isn’t a pushback” from Congress because Obama has made the legislative body “a non-entity.” Turley is alarmed by the drone strikes targeting American citizens suspected of terrorist activities abroad. Attorney General Eric Holder spoke at Turley’s alma mater, the University of Chicago, and in Turley’s words, discussed why the government should “vaporize a couple [of] Americans.” He went on to say, “President Obama went further and created a system by which Americans could be taken out by his sole discretion” and without a trial. Turley said, “The president is now asserting the right to kill any one of you by his authority…without a charge…and the result was applause.”\nTurley could only wonder, “We are really living in a parallel universe where the president is claiming the right to kill American civilians” and people are applauding his unilateral actions.\nSome argue that the Founders [or as he called them, the Framers] did not write the Constitution during poisonous times. Turley responded and said, “This Constitution was written during poisonous political times.” The Founders “didn’t like wars…they didn’t like executives getting us into wars.” Yet, “Look what happened in Libya…we must be reading different works” if you think the Founders would approve of an intervention in Libya.\nRosenkranz added to Turley’s point, using ObamaCare, immigration reform and the IRS targeting scandal as examples of extra-constitutional acts. Calling himself a “textualist,” he focused on the wording of the Constitution. From the Constitution, Rosenkranz read the phrase, “The president shall take care that these laws will be faithfully executed.” He pointed out that the phrase, “’shall take care’…is not optional, this is mandatory.” In his words, “Other folks will do the actual executing, but his duty to take care of the executing of the laws.” Also, “The president does have power to make enforcement choices; However, he has to make them faithfully.”\nHe gave a background on the reason behind this clause, “English kings had taken power to suspend the law unilaterally. The Framers expressly rejected that practice. That’s what this clause is doing here.”\nRosenkranz, referring to ObamaCare, said that one of the delays of the law’s implementation came via a blog post in July 2013. “I have lost track, the president has suspended or modified Obamacare some, is it 36 times by now, I’ve lost track.” The delays go against the law’s statutes, which he believed “is perfectly clear.”\nEven after he said, “Sometimes Congress leaves gaps,” Rosenkranz affirmed, “This is not such a case. The date is crystal clear: January 1, 2014. It could not be more explicit, it could not be so clear, you don’t need a lawyer to know what this means.” Rosenkranz said, “What you have is Obamacare: it is crystal clear and it tells you when it will be implemented.”\nYet, the blog post “makes no mention of this statutory effort” and to him, “the blog post raises the question of what ‘faithfully’ means.” Rosenkranz, referring to the delays, said, “This is wholesale suspension of a law” and the President “simply cannot mean to decline to execute the law at all.”\nHe found Obama’s comments on the delays “particularly troubling.” On August 19, 2013, Obama sought “a change in the law” and said, “He would prefer” some changes. Rosenkranz pointed out that President Obama said he would prefer to pick up the phone and call House Speaker John Boehner to change the law. “The climate was so toxic,” said Rosenkranz, but “the truth though, the President knows it, he wouldn’t even have to pick up the phone.” The House had several bills on the floor, one that would delay the employer mandate and another would delay the individual mandate. Obama “didn’t actually support the bill[s], to the contrary, he actually threatened to veto it.”\nRosenkranz warned, “This is, it’s really almost…the President actually seeming to prefer flouting the law as written, rather than supporting a statutory change that would achieve his desired results. This [seems more of] a willful violation of the [take care] clause.”\nAnd, Rosenkranz added, “this act was enacted years ago…literally, years of leave time, we couldn’t get our act together.” He felt that the failures are “a bit of an indictment of the law itself.” As he said before, “Congress was prepared to amend this law. The President could have [amended it].” “There should’ve been a legislative change [but Obama] actually threatened to veto it.” When asked by an audience member about why Obama would not sign any House bill to delay ObamaCare, he said:\n“The explicit reason, or purported reason, is it’s unnecessary. The actual reason, was that it was politically awkward. The reason why it was politically awkward: the house passed two things…one suspended the employer mandate… other one would’ve suspended the individual mandate.”\nIn other terms, “So signing one and vetoing the other” would’ve placed Obama in a “politically awkward” position.\nThe IRS targeting scandal is “an example that would horrify them [the Founders] even more: which is to declining to execute laws against his political friends only against his political adversaries.”\nPresident Obama “is trying to distance himself from the scandal” surrounding the IRS and targeting conservative groups. However, the “take care” clause is a “personal” responsibility for the president to oversee all parts of the executive branch.\nRosenkranz said, “What the President knew and when he knew it, is a certain sense, is beside the point. The point is, he should have known, he should have known it, [it] won’t do that the President erroneously said the IRS was an ‘independent agency’ nor will it do for him that he” found out via news reports like everyone else. “Not knowing what an executive agency is up to, let alone with not knowing that the IRS is a part of the executive branch…” is not encouraging, he said."

    "title": "Muslim Voices Against Radical Extremism",
    "section": "",
    "text": "At the Heritage Foundation recently, several voices against radical Islam and extreme Islamist ideology stood as a stark contrast to the spokesmen represented in the typical 24-hour news cycle. Naser Khader, a member of parliament in Denmark and of the Conservative People’s Party, spoke about stopping radical Islam’s spread, while Farahnaz Ispahani, former Pakistani parliament member and author, highlighted the inequality issues within this strain of radical Islam.\n\n\n\nheritage muslim voices event\n\n\nKhader said, “I went to the Middle East right after the Paris attacks, hoping to meet an outcry of condemnation of what happened in Paris, but I didn’t.” Much of the sentiment and opinion heard on his trip was, “Now the West can test its own medicine” and Khader said, “I heard different conspiracy theories of how the West did these terrorist attacks” in order to have “an excuse in order for the West to get involved in Arab affairs.”\nHe continued, “The reaction in the Arab world and the following debate…on the jihadist ideology has yet again made it crystal clear why Islam needs a reformation or a revolution.” Khader slammed political correctness, “[They who] insist on calling the Islamic State by the nickname, ‘Daesh’…because it has no connection with Islam.” He said, “When people try to disconnect Islam from the violence, the wheels come off.” Khader pointed out, “The religion is what the religious make of it.” It is not a matter of political correctness, but Khader said, “This is a dogma within religious parties” and “we cannot say that the Islamic State are not Muslims, that is what they call themselves, as they enslave, murder and massacre with a Koran in their hands.” By using names like Daesh, Khader elaborated, “You reduce the terrorist to no more than a game with weapons, but they are much more than that, they govern an area the size of Great Britain.” He added, “All of it is built on a version of Islam.”\nKhader said, “Let’s get rid of this political correctness and grab the evil by the root,” and “It is about time that Islam undergoes a Reformation.” He gave an example for the audience, in which he said, “I usually compare Islam and Christianity with two houses.” “Today,” Khader said, “Christianity is a wonderful house” full of free speech. On the flip side, Khader pointed out, “Today the house of Islam is damaged, there are holes all over and in the roof…it is really not a nice place to be.” He concluded, “The house of Islam needs a renovation.” In his opinion, “The reasons why Christianity is civilized today…there was a violent showdown” between parties within Christianity.\nWhat is the solution? Khader said, “If we are not succeeding in claiming Islam…then we have to show it is possible to be a democratic, sensible human being and a Muslim at the same time.” He admitted, “We must present strong religious argument” in order to change the tide of radical Islam, “the Muslim needs to view Allah differently” than they do today. He added, “Most Muslims see Him [God or Allah] as angry” instead of him being one of peace. Khader believed that “had [Mohammed] lived today, he would oppose” this ideology of an angry Allah. He said, “We carry a huge responsibility and our voice has to be loud and clear.” Muslims need to stand strong. “The Islamic State and all who sympathize with them must receive condemnation,” Khader acknowledged. He said, “We should intensify military actions to include boots on the ground, otherwise I don’t believe we can stop the Islamic State from doing more harm.” Additionally, “We have to bomb them ideologically as well” because “it is a battle of the mind and the heart.”\nKhader reaffirmed that Islam is “a peaceful religion.” He said, “We need to pull up our sleeves and start renovating the house of Islam, we should be inspired by the house of Christianity.” Khader worried, “If we don’t start this great renovation project…it will collapse” because “there is no alternative to a reformation of Islam.” Interestingly enough, Khader pointed out, “Martin Luther had the support of the empire, we need to make it clear to have our leaders support us as well.”\nIspahani said, “Islamic extremism is the primary national security and human rights concern of the world today.” She affirmed that Islamist extremism is the “primary motivator of acts of terrorism worldwide.” “Muslims have devolved into a dozen different sects,” she said, therefore she believed that “pluralism within Islam has to be recognized.” She pointed out that this extremist ideology has led to “human rights abuses including the oppression of women…as well as governmental tyranny.” Ispahani noted, “The brunt of Islamist extremism is borne by Muslim women and religious minorities, both Muslim and non-Muslim…also religious minorities such as Christians and Zoroastrians.” She said, “Whether it is Yazidi Christians in Syria and Iraq, Coptic Christians in Egypt or Hindus, Christians and Sikhs in Pakistan…non-Muslims have often been targeted for exclusion and marginalization.”\nIspahani added, “The Islamist worldview is stagnant” because today’s followers “want women to live by 12th century standards.” She pointed out that women were honored and revered in Islam back to the days of the Prophet Mohammed. “Prophet Mohammed’s wife… was a businesswoman…his daughter Fatima was held up as an example of piety,” she said. Today, “Islamists insist on recreating the norms of the earlier eras,” Ispahani declared. “Groups such as ISIS have been able to recruit women who join extremist men in oppressing fellow women and even acting as facilitators of renewed slavery,” she lamented. But, an interesting note was when she claimed Jews, expelled from Spain due to the Spanish Inquisition, went to Muslim countries and paid for protection, an old practice in the Muslim world."

    "title": "How Reagan Won the Cold War",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Ronald Reagan’s legacy, long after his passing, continues to be distorted by the leftist academic community, one professor noted at a panel discussion held at the Heritage Foundation. Francis Marlo, an associate professor of International Relations at the Marine Corps Command and Staff College, said that the Left does not like giving Ronald Reagan credit for ending the Cold War.\nThe panel discussion centered around the recently published book, “The Grand Strategy that Won the Cold War,” and Marlo’s remarks centered around correcting the record on Ronald Reagan’s Cold War exploits. Marlo stated, “The intent of this book is to address those flaws, highlight those flaws” and to correct the narrative.\nHe said that at one point, one observer called Reagan “an amiable dunce” who wandered around the White House during his two terms, which is a common opinion of his detractors. However, “that has largely been discredited,” Marlo said. He pointed out that there are books that parrot this viewpoint even now, such as a book by Francis Fitzgerald, called Way Out in the Blue. Marlo continued, “There’s been a gradual change now; unfortunately, the story is only slightly better.”\n“Ronald Reagan,” Marlo said, “gets credit, but gets credit for changing” during the Cold War. He added that academics perpetuate the narrative that Reagan shifted to “becoming a strong believer in détente” between 1984-1985. “This is the Reagan reversal story,” Marlo noted, and the narrative is of Reagan “becoming a moderate [then] the Cold War ends.”\nContinuing the narrative, “Gorbachev gets most of the credit” for the end of the Cold War because academics believed “Reagan sees the light and sees the Cold War is pointless…and it ends.” In Marlo’s words, “That is accepted academic wisdom” today and “that account is horribly flawed.” In fact, he said, “The Reagan administration…did more to worsen the Soviet problems” in the 1980s and Marlo pointed out, “That doesn’t get noticed by academics writing about the administration today.”\nTo strengthen his point, Marlo cited a government strategic document known as NSDD 75, which was Reagan’s national security strategy directive. This directive pointed out the internal problems that the Soviets were having, and as Marlo said, “[It] was never overwritten, it was never changed” by following administrations. Marlo continued, “This reads like a hardline document” and there is “no evidence to suggest” that Reagan went soft in the mid-1980s.\nToday, “the current academics treat it as something that suddenly happened,” referring to the struggling Soviet economy in the 1980s, and the Left believed “Reagan happened to be there” to see its collapse. However, Marlo said, academics don’t realize “Reagan never changed” his approach to the Soviet Union and the Cold War. “It’s just not true” that Reagan reversed course halfway through his presidency, said Marlo, because “he never dismissed the idea” of negotiation. Marlo added, “The idea that he didn’t endorse it is just wrong [because] he never changed his mind toward it.”\nReagan “didn’t change his views overnight because Mikhail Gorbachev showed up,” Marlo noted, “Ronald Reagan was a very good politician and had dealt with a lot of smooth politicians.” He continued, “Just because the media swooned over Gorbachev” does not mean Reagan did so and there was little evidence to suggest it.\nWhat set Ronald Reagan apart? “He understood the stakes of the Cold War, that communism and freedom couldn’t coexist,” Marlo said. He told the story of Ronald Reagan’s tenure as president of the Screen Actors’ Guild, known as SAG. There, Reagan saw communism first-hand when dealing with a “communist-backed union” which leveled threats against his life. Marlo pointed out, “[Reagan] winds up sleeping with a gun under his pillow for fear that he will become a target.” This was Reagan’s “first taste of what communism is about.”\nWhittaker Chambers’ book, “Witness,” could have influenced Reagan’s approach toward communism because to Chambers, it was a fervent ideology. Marlo said, “The portrayal Chambers gives as a sort of rival faith, deeply affects Ronald Reagan [because] it was ugly and it was nasty.” Whittaker’s phrase that described communism, “the focus of the concentrated evil of our time” was echoed in some of Reagan’s own anti-communism and pro-freedom speeches.\nPhoto by The Official CTBTO Photostream \nPhoto by The Official CTBTO Photostream"

The four professors focused on the origins of the Balfour Declaration and the creation of the Jewish state of Israel.\nNabil Matar, a professor of English, History and Religious Studies at the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities, criticized British Christians’ link between Zionism and Christian “restoration.” Restoration, in his words, describes how Jews will be restored to the Holy Land of Israel in accordance with Christian biblical prophecies. British Christians “identified ‘restoration’ as Zionism” and the British could not contradict this Christian doctrine, said Matar. He continued, “Numerous English writers became addicted to” the end-of-the-world biblical prophecies, such as when “Christ will destroy their enemies, the papists, the Catholics [etc].”\n“Thus,” Matar said, “was born the call of ‘restoration’ of Jews to Palestine” and he said it was “disingenuous” because “Christian doctrine never spoke of ‘restoration.’” Matar claimed that “restoration” was found only three times in the Christian Bible and the “militaristic disciples” asked Jesus Christ about restoring the kingdom by force. His second “disingenuous” reason was that the Christians “appeal to ‘restorationism’ by British Christian writers…was intended to rid England of whatever Jewish population there was.”\nThe defeat of naturalization in the United Kingdom is an example of “the most telling anti-Jewish ‘restorationism.’” James Balfour, the British foreign secretary who wrote the Balfour Declaration to help create the Jewish state of Israel, believed religion was equal to philosophy. Matar called it silly to conflate the two, and said Balfour was “a Zionist” and an “imperialist.” This “ruse” was the “conflation of Zionism and ‘restorationism.’” Then, the “British government began to confront the benign” non-Jewish populations and it began the “gullible restorationism” of the United Kingdom.\nMounira Soliman, an English professor at American University in Cairo, said that the Balfour Declaration pointed “to the Jewish Zionist efforts” and “the Palestinians were mostly unaware of it and therefore had to deal with its outcomes.” She said, “A modified version drafted by the Zionist committee…it is not surprising that the Arabs distrust[ed]” the British and Jews. The drafting process did not include Arabs, Soliman said. She continued, “This foreign group make, quite literally” a land of their own and “various actors [U.S. and the U.K….prefer to deal with others than dealing with the Palestinians.”\nThe Balfour Declaration “do not feature the perspectives of the Palestinians” and she lamented, “not much is written about the Balfour Declaration as such, giving a sense that there is not much out there.” She noted, “The topic is certainly a part of Palestinian [popular] culture.” However, most references are literary and not popular culture.\nHani Bawardi, associate professor of history at University of Michigan-Dearborn, outlined the Palestinian side of the Balfour Declaration. Bawardi claimed that Zionism “traveled like lightning” and some of the top motivations for Zionism were “religious feelings” and “economic greed.” He noted that the Balfour Declaration was designed to protect economic interests because it was to “protect France’s and the British’s largest investment in the Suez Canal.” He continued that the West and its rich financiers wanted to “drag the U.S. into World War One” and a congressional investigation “was shut down.” The West’s control of the League of Nations ended up “dividing Syria under the mandate” from the organization, Bawardi said. He claimed, “The cause of the trouble was mass immigration and loss of land by Palestinian peasants” in Syria during their civil war in 1925 and that “Syrian nationalist identity was soon absorbed by Arab nationalism.”\nMark Bayer, a Texas-San Antonio assistant English professor, compared William Shakespeare’s “Merchant of Venice” to the Balfour Declaration. Specifically, he said, “The infamous ‘pound of flesh’ in Shakespeare’s ‘Merchant of Venice’” is the comparable example. He said that the issue is both “communities already convinced of the veracity of their claim” and “both the British and the Zionists appear to deploy the same language.” He said that Zionism was “politically and militarily intertwined” for the British. But, the “pound of flesh” is a “rhetorically powerful Shakespearean metaphor” that led to the “iron law or use of irresistible force to reach Zionist demands.” Bayer warned, “These are words not to be forgotten by Arabs.”\n“Zionists,” Bayer said, “were able to appropriate Arab land” through this Shakespearean “pound of flesh” metaphor. He claimed a Zionist leader “took the Balfour Accord from Great Britain.” He pointed out the differences between Zionists and the Palestinians, “we only disagree on the interpretation and the fairness of the declaration.” He added, “Israel wants to strip the remaining flesh from the occupied territories.” The “Merchant of Venice” character Shylock, in Bayer’s opinion, “represents cruel authority,” now, post-Holocaust, “demanding what is rightfully his.”\nPhoto by Zachi Evenor"

    "text": "Headlining the total virus deaths ignores its mortality rate and how many people have recovered from it\nBased on recent statistics and increased coronavirus testing, the U.S. mortality (or fatality) rate sits slightly higher than the seasonal pneumonia (i.e. flu). According to Johns Hopkins University’s coronavirus tracker, the U.S. has an observed case-fatality ratio of 3.3%. By comparison, the United Kingdom outpaces the rest of the world at an observed 15.2% mortality rate, followed by Mexico at 10.9%.\nContrary to consistently-misleading media headlines, the U.S. is in comparatively safe territory, while underdeveloped countries such as Mexico, Ecuador (6.5%), and Iran (5.6%) struggle to contain the pandemic. Most headlines cite the total number of fatalities per day or per month to drum up hysteria, fear, and panic. One such example is CBS News’s headline, which read, “California surpasses 10,000 coronavirus deaths.” The headline did not acknowledge that the figure represented a total sum of deaths due to the pandemic and could have mislead readers to assume it was a daily death count. Also, the CBS News article did not mention the relatively-low case-fatality ratio."

    "text": "Coronavirus mortality rate is higher than the flu, but not by much\nThe seasonal flu’s mortality rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), was 2% in 2017, which is about the average rate in the U.S. each year. By comparison, the coronavirus case-fatality ratio is slightly higher at 3.3%. Though both diseases are fatal and dangerous to one’s health, the statistics disprove the false narrative that the coronavirus is far and above more dangerous than the seasonal flu. To give statistical context, more Americans die each year of heart disease than the flu, and by extension, the coronavirus. In 2017, 23% of deaths in the U.S. were due to heart disease, or over 647,000 deaths. At this point in time, it is not clear whether the coronavirus would surpass the number of deaths caused by heart disease, accidents, and other leading causes of death in the country."

    "text": "Hydroxychloroquine can be used to help treat coronavirus patients in some cases\nPresident Donald Trump insisted that hydroxychloroquine could be the miracle drug to help coronavirus patients recover from the virus, which was met with widespread media criticism. Both the media and some medical experts slammed Trump’s claims, although there are some cases where early hydroxychloroquine treatment helped patients recover. Now, the drug has been sworn off as giving a false sense of hope, though it has had some success in early treatments.\nBut the underlying point that hydroxychloroquine had no significant effects on coronavirus patients was a false and potentially-harmful narrative. Just as with any other drug or medicine, patients react differently to different treatments, which could derive from one’s genetics, pre-existing conditions, or allergies. It is disingenuous to write off a potential life-saving drug for some people at the cost of scoring political points against the president."

The U.S. continues to ramp up coronavirus testing, and with it, previously-undiagnosed infected patients tested positive. But solely testing positive is not a death sentence. Instead, some patients who tested positive were asymptomatic and did not suffer harmful effects as others.\nThe media’s lazy narrative did not account for the varying effects of the virus on people’s health, whether it was asymptomatic, mild symptoms, or severe symptoms. Additionally, the media pointed to several states (New York and New Jersey, to name a few) where increased testing did not lead to a rise in positive tests. But, like any ongoing developments, it was unclear whether there would be another spike in positive tests as testing increases. Eventually, the positive tests will go down as testing continues to ramp up, which the media neglected to point out in their reporting."

The Virginia government claimed that it would allow them to count how many tests have been done each day, despite the concerns about potentially-inflated numbers.\nIn other states such as Arizona and Ohio, their respective state health departments denied that they double-counted positive coronavirus cases.\nIn short, it is untrue that double-counting a person’s positive tests was as widespread as social media rumors suggested, unless you are a Virginia resident."

    "text": "Children and youth are mostly unharmed by the coronavirus; the majority of fatalities come from older, obese, or patients with pre-existing conditions\nAlthough children and youth have tested positive for the coronavirus, the majority of children and youth are unaffected by the coronavirus. A small percentage of all admitted and virus-positive patients were children or youth, while the majority of patients were elderly, older, obese, or had pre-existing health conditions that made them susceptible to the virus. CDC research pointed out that child and youth hospitalizations do occur for the virus, but the “case-fatality rate remains low” even for children with severe coronavirus symptoms.\nIt is not that children and youth cannot contract the virus and that they are immune from the virus. The point is that they are in as much danger as the older, elderly, obese, and individuals with pre-existing conditions.\nIt is categorically unfair and dishonest for the media and medical professionals to recommend school closures, as children and youth need classroom instruction, social interactions, and sports to develop skills. This age group is mostly unaffected and it is at a far lower risk than older or elderly Americans. Schools can observe social distancing and mandate mask-wearing, along with frequent hand washing and other safe practices. Shutting schools down completely would have significant educational and social consequences in children and youth for years to come."

    "text": "Shutting down the economy again will affect more than deaths, such as affecting mental health, payments of mortgages or rents, domestic violence victims, jobs, education, and many other factors\nThe economic shutdown had far more lasting and punitive effects than some predicted, such as suicides, illicit drug use, mental health issues such as depression, domestic violence incidents, job losses or pay cuts, loss of an academic semester for college students and K-12 students.\nOne report mentioned how domestic abuse could escalate during the pandemic and another alleged that world hunger could be exacerbated by a prolonged economic shutdown.\nOther reports pointed to a potential increase in opioid drug addiction and use, which could lead to overdose deaths in the near future. Mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression, have risen during the pandemic, too, due to a lack of social interaction and disruption of routines and social activities.\nMillennials are facing a double-whammy of the 2007 recession combined with the pandemic-induced recession, as the Wall Street Journal noted. They hold significant debt, are more susceptible to losing their jobs than older workers, and do not have enough savings to weather prolonged joblessness. The pandemic is exacerbating their financial situation and it could lead to serious economic and social ramifications in the near and far future.\nThe economic shutdown also impacted education, particularly among low-income students. Low-income students typically lack access to the internet and educational support in homework and extracurricular activities. Forcing families to decide between staying at home to help their child learn and attend class virtually or working is an example of terrible policy."

These organizations originally said that mask-wearing was not necessary for those not infected or asymptomatic. But, weeks after that announcement, the organizations reversed course and urged people to wear masks.\nThe CDC admitted that the reversal was due to its concerns about mask supplies. The CDC feared that if they recommended mask-wearing, the country would run out of masks for medical professionals and hospital staff. Although studies have disproven the utility of mask-wearing to prevent disease from spreading, the CDC should have gotten its story straight and be more consistent to instill public trust and confidence.\nThe WHO also bungled its pandemic response, first telling the world that China’s government contained the virus’s spread. Then, several weeks later, the WHO admitted that the virus spread beyond China’s borders and that it was officially a global pandemic. The WHO also avoided criticizing China for covering up the virus’s origins and its spread. For example, Dr. Michael Ryan, the WHO’s Health Emergencies Program chief, said that he was “very pleased to hear a very consistent message coming from China, which is one of openness to such an approach.”"

The Chinese government published misleading and false claims about how it had stopped the virus from spreading beyond its borders, which the WHO often cited in its press conferences. This blatant misinformation hid the reality: the virus had already spread to Europe and the U.S. by the time government authorities enacted travel bans.\nJust as quickly as the virus spread across the world, the Chinese Communists covered up the virus’s origins, which was allegedly a wet market in Wuhan. The government also denied a report that the virus was accidentally released by a virology research lab in Wuhan and the mainstream media joined the communist chorus of denial.\nAs Bill Gertz reported, China deceived the world about the virus’s true origins, which was from the aforementioned virology laboratory. Ever since his report, neither the mainstream media nor Chinese government have been able to effectively discredit his reporting. The Wuhan Institute of Virology, Gertz said, is “linked to the Chinese government’s covert virological weapons program.” He correctly pointed out that the pandemic could have been avoided “if China had taken the proper steps early on in the outbreak.”\nOther whistleblowers on the Chinese Communist cover-up were silenced, which included several Chinese doctors. One doctor, the late Dr. Li Wenliang, fought the government’s narrative about the virus’s origins and his claims were “repressed mercilessly” by the Communist government. Unfortunately, he died from the virus and many Chinese people hailed him as a hero.\nThe Trump administration has put the blame squarely on China, but the media has moved on from holding China accountable to blaming Trump’s pandemic response."
